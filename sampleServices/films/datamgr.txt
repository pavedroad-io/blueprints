DESCRIPTION:

The datamgr template provide a low-code or no-code environment
for creating a microservice that manages a data base object.
You customize the microservice to your use case by creating a
definitions file.

To generate a definitions file you can use:

roadctl describe templates datamgr > mydefinitions.yaml

Data attributes are defined in the Tables field and tables can
be nested.  All records are automatically assigned a UUID that
acts as the key.
